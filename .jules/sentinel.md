## 2025-05-05 - target="_blank" without rel="noopener noreferrer"
**Vulnerability:** A `target="_blank"` anchor link was missing the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute in `src/components/Team.tsx`.
**Learning:** This exposes the application to a "reverse tabnabbing" attack where the newly opened tab can gain a reference to the `window.opener` object of the original page and potentially redirect it to a malicious site.
**Prevention:** Always add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links that open in a new tab via `target="_blank"`.
